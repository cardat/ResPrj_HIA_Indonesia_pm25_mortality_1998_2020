It is built using the R targets package which is a Make-like pipeline tool. The targets framework allow users to develop and edit the pipeline at all stage while ensuring reproducibility and efficiency. Each target is designed to complete one step of the HIA (whether that be defining the input, cleaning the data, analysing the data or creating an output or visualisation). Targets are linked by the dependence, for example, an analysis step (target) may depend on cleaned environmental and cleaned health data, as well as a custom function to perform the analysis. Changes made to any target (or global object or function) will invalidate downstream targets. On the subsequent run of the pipeline, the changed target and all downstream targets will be run again, ensuring the effects of the changed target are propagated to the rest of the pipeline. At the same time, if a target is not affected by the changed target, it will not be rerun.

You will need to have R installed and it is strongly recommended to also install RStudio. 3.2 Download the repository code Go to the GitHub repository for ResPrj_HIA_Indonesia_pm25_mortality_1998_2020. Download the repository by clicking the green &lt; &gt; Code button, then “Download ZIP”. Extract the downloaded zip file to an appropriate location on your computer. Alternatively, if you are comfortable with using Git, you may clone the repository. 3.3 Download the input data All datasets are publicly available from the following sources: Modelled mortality data: Institute of Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) via the GBD Results Tool Modelled PM2.5 exposure data: Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group (ACAG) as part of the SatPM2.5 (Satellite-derived PM2.5) dataset (older versions archived) Geographical boundaries: Database of Global Administrative Area Please note the licencing and conditions of use for each dataset before using them in your work. The specific dataset versions used in the development of the pipeline are available in the Cloud CARDAT repository to approved researchers. IHME data for Southeast Asia, as of 2025-06-03 ACAG SatPM2.5 Global V5.GL.02 GADM v4.0.4 3.4 Run the pipeline The pipeline is defined in the _targets.R file, while global objects are defined in config.R. Helper code designed to run interactively (line-by-line) is provided in main.R and can be used to examine, run and visualise the pipeline and its outputs. You must define the paths to the input files in config.R. All variables indir.geography and infile.geography (GADM data), indir.mort and infile.mort (IHME data), and indir.pm25 and infile.pm25 (ACAG data) must be provided and point to the corresponding input data files you have downloaded. The mapping of province names is included in this repository under the metadata/ directory. Ensure the infile.locname_map variable is correctly defined for this mapping file.
